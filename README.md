# TF-IDF-and-Cosine-Similarity

Built a movie plot search engine using PySpark and Databricks, applying TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity techniques to rank movie plots based on relevance to user queries.

Processed and cleaned a large dataset from Carnegie Movie Summary Corpus using MapReduce, removing stopwords and constructing a tf-idf matrix for each term in the document.

Implemented a search functionality that supports both single and multi-term queries, returning top 10 most relevant movie plots based on cosine similarity calculations.

Utilized metadata mapping to transform Wikipedia movie IDs into movie names for user-friendly results, enhancing the usability of the search engine.
